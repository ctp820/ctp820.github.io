      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>
        Colin studied at Yale University, where he proved himself a brilliant history student and wrote his senior thesis on the skyway's effect on street-level retail shopping in St. Paul, MN. In 2008, Colin began his career as an investment banking analyst at William Blair in Chicago. After two terrible, god awful years there, he moved on to RCP Advisors which is a lower middle market private equity fund of funds. Eventually, Colin realized finance was not one of his core passions and decided to transition careers into brand management. It is for this reason that he came to Kellogg. Next year, Colin will be working as a brand manager for General Mills in his hometown of Minneapolis, MN.
