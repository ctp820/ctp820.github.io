    <h2>About Platform Tennis ("Paddle")</h2>

    <p>
      <strong>About</strong>: Platform Tennis is an American racquet sport enjoyed by thousands of people of all ages. It is the only racquet sport that players can enjoy outdoors in cold weather. This unique appeal attracts people who desire fresh air, competition, and social engagement - all on a chilly winter's day or night. The sport is played at private clubs, public facilities, and in backyards at both highly competitive and purely recreational levels. Because it is easy to learn, it is enjoyed by players as young as eight and as old as old bones allow.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>The Court</strong>: The game is played on an aluminum deck about 1/3 the size of a court is surrounded by a 12' high superstructure with taut, 16-gauge "chicken wire" fencing which allows play off the walls, as in racquetball and squash. Historically, the court has been elevated or on a platform. (When founders invented the sport in 1928 they erected the first court on the side of a hill. A platform was needed to keep the court level and was helpful with snow removal.) The base of an elevated platform tennis court is usually enclosed, allowing for a heating system beneath the deck (propane, natural gas or kerosene.) The heating system melts ice off the aggregate deck surface, allowing athletes to play outdoors in all weather conditions. Most courts have lighting systems ao the game can be enjoyed day or night. As the game has grown, the court has adapted to its surroundings. In areas of the south, for instance, with no need for heating elements, more courts are being built at the ground-level. This can benefit spectators and help keep construction costs down.

    <p>
      <strong>The Equipment</strong>: Platform tennis paddles are made of a composite material with aerodynamic holes drilled in the head. Paddles are approximately 18" long. The spongy, rubber ball measures 2.5" in diameter. A flocking material on its exterior keeps the ball from skidding.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>The Name of the Game</strong>: Players often refer to platform tennis as "paddle," as in "Are you playing paddle tonight?" With the re-emergence of paddle tennis on the West Coast (basically, a down-sized game of tennis,) this has many people confused. To further the problem, there is paddle ball (an urban sport played against a single wall) and paddle (much like paddle tennis).

  <h2>Grow the Sport</h2>

  <h3>Due to increasing demand for platform tennis, an APTA "Grow the Sport Committee" assists current and future markets in placing new courts in their areas.</h3>

  <p>
  Committee members are available to the local facilities to assist in preliminary planning, financial planning and implementation strategies. Please visit the listings below for court and space planning thoughts, financial planning considerations and implementation suggestions. An important component to this committee is to offer financial assistance to public access facilities in the form of Grants and/or Loans. This assistance is to be the final piece of the financial strategy, without which the courts would not be possible. Since the committee’s inception in 2006, the APTA has awarded grants to facilities around the country totaling more than $227,000 (May, 2013) with all 7 regions benefiting from this program. The financial option of an interest-free loan was added in 2011 and to date (May, 2013), the APTA has loaned $113,000 to new & existing facilities. If you are a platform tennis enthusiast looking to add a court or multiple courts to your existing facility or if you are trying to bring the sport to your area, please contact us today for assistance. We are here to help you every step of the way and urge you to take advantage of these resources as the APTA carries out one of its major missions – Growing the Sport of platform tennis.

  That’s right…all over the country! Not just in typical hotspots such as Chicago or the tri-state area, but in Charleston, South Carolina, Yellowstone in Wyoming, Richmond, Virginia, Boulder, Colorado, etc. And the numbers seem to grow every year.
